The Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ provides several container classes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The "best" container to use depends on the
specific requirements of your program and the type of data you're working with.

Here are some of the most commonly used containers in STL and their use cases:

* std::vector: A dynamic array that automatically resizes as elements are added or removed. It is useful when you need to store a large number of elements and when
random access to elements is required.

* std::list: A doubly-linked list that stores elements in a linear order. It is useful when you need to insert or remove elements from the middle of a container
frequently.

* std::deque: A double-ended queue that allows elements to be inserted or removed from either end. It is useful when you need to add or remove elements from both ends
frequently.

* std::set: An ordered container that stores unique elements. It is useful when you need to store elements in a sorted order and quickly check if an element already
exists in the container.

* std::map: An ordered container that stores elements in the form of key-value pairs. It is useful when you need to store elements in a sorted order and quickly look up
elements by their key.

* std::unordered_set: An unordered container that stores unique elements. It is useful when you need to store elements quickly and check if an element already exists in
the container.

* std::unordered_map: An unordered container that stores elements in the form of key-value pairs. It is useful when you need to store elements quickly and look up
elements by their key.

It's important to note that, the time complexity of operation on the container depends on the underlying data structure of the container. The time complexity of each
container's operations is different. For example, std::vector has O(1) random access, while std::list has O(n) and std::set has O(log n) for insertion/deletion.

It's always better to choose the container based on your use case and the requirements of your program.
